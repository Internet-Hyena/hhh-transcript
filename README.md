# Hypertext Hecktier Chatlog

## B33> What's this?

This website is a static transcript of the flash game on [panel #666](https://beyondcanon.com/story/666) of [Homestuck: Beyond Canon](https://beyondcanon.com/) (internally called "Hyperbolic Helltier Chamber"). It aims to provide a simplified reading experience, allowing the text to be viewed (and searched) all at once, without manually playing the entire visual novel.

This was made possible by [unrpyc](https://github.com/CensoredUsername/unrpyc), a ren'py script decompiler.

This is a work in progress created by one random fan. Please be patient! In the future, I hope to add a quirk remover, a more engaging page style, and various other accessibility features.
