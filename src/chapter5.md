<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (uncomfortable): *dp hesitantly crawls up to their phone, curiously pawing at the device and feigning ignorance as though they don't know what the fuck it is because theyre kind of embarrassed to talk to the sprite^2 they know is at the other end*</p>

![TODO](./images/1/characters/davepetasprite/davepeta_thinking.webp)
<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (thinking): *dp musters the strength to slowly inch a claw to the scr33n... will they answer in time... theyre lowkey starting to catch a vibe with that ringtone though... they might fuck around and toy with this vibe... having a grand old time with this vibe... whole time the vibe fears for its life, the vibe is trying to play dead but that would never stop ol' dp* uh oh...</p>

<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (annoyed): Hello? Haven't you heard it's rude to keep a lady waiting?</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (annoyed): I bet you were doing that thing where you start roleplaying outloud to yourself about picking up the phone instead of just picking the damn thing up.</p>

<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (pokerface): um</p>

![TODO](./images/1/characters/davepetasprite/davepeta_cute.webp)
<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (cute): nipah</p>

![](./images/5/characters/jasprose/jasprose_thinking.webp)
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (thinking): I was beginning to think I wouldn't be able to get any service, what with all the interference between <span class="thepoint">The Plot Point's</span> hyperconcentrated essentiality field and Midnight City's superplausitional canonical deniability.</p>

![TODO](./images/1/characters/davepetasprite/davepeta_pokerface.webp)
<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (pokerface): i hate that i understand what youre saying when you speak like this</p>

![](./images/5/characters/jasprose/jasprose_laugh.webp)
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (laugh): Isn't it delightful?</p>

<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE: well to reduce our word count and knead our poor brain biscuits ill since youve b33n gone, we just call it <span class="thepoint">The Point</span> now</p>

![](./images/5/characters/jasprose/jasprose_pleased.webp)
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (pleased): How delightfully quirky! Let's get to ours, shall we?</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE: Personally, I've been having an incredible time!</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (thinking): Other than the Crocker patriarch and his new tall, dark, and loathsome beau hounding us.</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (annoyed): They've been on our tails this whole night!</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (annoyed): In my opinion, this operation could do without a pair of hard-boiled hall monitors filling the night air with pheromones, gun powder, and the scent of Barbasol.</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (annoyed): Eugh!</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (laugh): But hey! Downing cold drinks and dodging hot lead, Midnight City certainly doesn't disappoint!</p>

<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (uncomfortable): jasprose... youve b33n drinking?</p>

<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (annoyed): Please.</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (pleased): You know it's only milk bars for me.</p>

![](./images/5/characters/jasprose/jasprose_curious.webp)
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (curious): Well, perhaps the occasional martini bar. Though with them, it's more difficult to find bartenders that won't bat an eye when I order a glass of that delectable matronal ambrosia.</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (pleased): Speaking of, I've made fantastic progress with the enchanting, yet problematic Ms. Crocker.</p>

<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (thinking): “enchanting yet prowlblematic”</p>
<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (laugh): thats gotta be your favorite combination</p>

<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (laugh): Guilty as charged!</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (pleased): Sigh, it's almost a shame I'll have to pass her off soon!</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (thinking): Her politics are still a little eye-brow raising, but they won't raise any torches and pitchforks yet.</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (curious): We've also had some developments from my new favorite foppish lunk, the inimitable Mr. English. Though he does seem to be locked in the particularly stubborn throes of his broken-hearted malaise.</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (pleased): I'm confident I can tear past the pitiable plush exterior and reveal the fragrant potpourri of heroism that lies within before curtain call!</p>

<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (neutral): sounds like youve had a real eventful... uh</p>
<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (thinking): how many w33ks of developments has this b33n i wasnt fully purring attention</p>

<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (thinking): Weeks?</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (laugh): Oh Davepeta, we've only been out on the town for a single, sensual, enlightening night!</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (curious): Anywho, while still on the subject of the stubborn and problematic... How goes your work on the linchpin of this “oper8tion”?</p>

<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (pokerface): well i mean</p>
<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (pokerface): its going</p>

<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (uncomfortable): JR were fucked</p>
<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (thinking): well actually, were probably fine i guess since its like hyper-time so its okay in the grand scheme of shit</p>
<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (uncomfortable): but god daaaaaaaamn its 8 steps forward 7 leaps back every session</p>
<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (uncomfortable): this therapist shit is not easy</p>
<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (thinking): hmm yes the way you smashed that 3rd 8-ball indicates you have unresolved f33lings about your father</p>
<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (pokerface): oh you dont have a father? our species doesnt even know what the fuck that is?</p>
<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (thinking): well fuck me then i dont know</p>
<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (pokerface): youd probably be way better at this than me</p>

<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (pleased): I would, yes.</p>

<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (uncomfortable): im in hell and you dont even care</p>
<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (laugh): it turns out hell is trying to get vriska serket to change her mind</p>

<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (curious): Yeesh, and you've been at this for how long?</p>

<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (thinking): well on the outside its only b33n maybe an hour or so.</p>
<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (thinking): which would translate to Centralized <span class="the-point">Point</span> Time (C<span class="the-point">P</span>T) as maybe about</p>
<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (pokerface): 4 years</p>

<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (shocked): 4 years?!</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (shocked): What have you even been doing there for 4 years?</p>

<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE: *dp slides up against the doorframe all slick-like, folds their arms and cocks their head forward, dropping the shades just enough for you to steal a glance at their highly coveted neon ganderbulbs*</p>
<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (cute): chilling</p>

<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (curious): Chilling.</p>

<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE: yeah</p>

<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (annoyed): That's all you've been doing? Chilling?</p>

<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (pokerface): p much</p>

<p class="jasprosesprite">JASPROSESPRITE (laugh): Fucking incredible.</p>

<p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE (laugh): god can you imagine</p>
