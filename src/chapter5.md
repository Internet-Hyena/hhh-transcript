<p class="davepetasprite"><span class="prefix">DAVEPETASPRITE^2  (uncomfortable): B33 <</span> *dp hesitantly crawls up to their phone, curiously pawing at the device and feigning ignorance as though they don't know what the fuck it is because theyre kind of embarrassed to talk to the sprite^2 they know is at the other end*</p>

<p class="davepetasprite"><span class="prefix">DAVEPETASPRITE^2  (thinking): B33 <</span> *dp musters the strength to slowly inch a claw to the scr33n... will they answer in time... theyre lowkey starting to catch a vibe with that ringtone though... they might fuck around and toy with this vibe... having a grand old time with this vibe... whole time the vibe fears for its life, the vibe is trying to play dead but that would never stop ol' dp* uh oh...</p>

![Jasprose with her arms folded disdainfully.](./images/5/characters/jasprose/jasprose_annoyed.webp)
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (annoyed):</span> Hello? Haven't you heard it's rude to keep a lady waiting?</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (annoyed):</span> I bet you were doing that thing where you start roleplaying outloud to yourself about picking up the phone instead of just picking the damn thing up.</p>

<p class="davepetasprite"><span class="prefix">DAVEPETASPRITE^2  (pokerface): B33 <</span> um</p>

![Davepeta squinches their eyes and curls their fists into paws, making a kissy face.](./images/1/characters/davepetasprite/davepeta_cute.webp)
<p class="davepetasprite"><span class="prefix">DAVEPETASPRITE^2  (cute): B33 <</span> nipah</p>

![Jasprose cocks an eyebrow and puts her index finger on her chin.](./images/5/characters/jasprose/jasprose_thinking.webp)
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (thinking):</span> I was beginning to think I wouldn't be able to get any service, what with all the interference between <span class="thepoint">The Plot Point's</span> hyperconcentrated essentiality field and Midnight City's superplausitional canonical deniability.</p>

![Davepeta, with a neutral expression](./images/1/characters/davepetasprite/davepeta_pokerface.webp)
<p class="davepetasprite"><span class="prefix">DAVEPETASPRITE^2  (pokerface): B33 <</span> i hate that i understand what youre saying when you speak like this</p>

![Jasprose giggles.](./images/5/characters/jasprose/jasprose_laugh.webp)
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (laugh):</span> Isn't it delightful?</p>

<p class="davepetasprite"><span class="prefix">DAVEPETASPRITE^2: B33 <</span> well to reduce our word count and knead our poor brain biscuits ill since youve b33n gone, we just call it <span class="thepoint">The Point</span> now</p>

![Jasprose, looking pleased.](./images/5/characters/jasprose/jasprose_pleased.webp)
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (pleased):</span> How delightfully quirky! Let's get to ours, shall we?</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2:</span> Personally, I've been having an incredible time!</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (thinking):</span> Other than the Crocker patriarch and his new tall, dark, and loathsome beau hounding us.</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (annoyed):</span> They've been on our tails this whole night!</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (annoyed):</span> In my opinion, this operation could do without a pair of hard-boiled hall monitors filling the night air with pheromones, gun powder, and the scent of Barbasol.</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (annoyed):</span> Eugh!</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (laugh):</span> But hey! Downing cold drinks and dodging hot lead, Midnight City certainly doesn't disappoint!</p>

![Davepeta, uncomfortable](./images/1/characters/davepetasprite/davepeta_uncomfortable.webp)
<p class="davepetasprite"><span class="prefix">DAVEPETASPRITE^2  (uncomfortable): B33 <</span> jasprose... youve b33n drinking?</p>

<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (annoyed):</span> Please.</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (pleased):</span> You know it's only milk bars for me.</p>

![Jasprose, curious](./images/5/characters/jasprose/jasprose_curious.webp)
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (curious):</span> Well, perhaps the occasional martini bar. Though with them, it's more difficult to find bartenders that won't bat an eye when I order a glass of that delectable matronal ambrosia.</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (pleased):</span> Speaking of, I've made fantastic progress with the enchanting, yet problematic Ms. Crocker.</p>

<p class="davepetasprite"><span class="prefix">DAVEPETASPRITE^2  (thinking): B33 <</span> “enchanting yet prowlblematic”</p>
<p class="davepetasprite"><span class="prefix">DAVEPETASPRITE^2  (laugh): B33 <</span> thats gotta be your favorite combination</p>

<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (laugh):</span> Guilty as charged!</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (pleased):</span> Sigh, it's almost a shame I'll have to pass her off soon!</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (thinking):</span> Her politics are still a little eye-brow raising, but they won't raise any torches and pitchforks yet.</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (curious):</span> We've also had some developments from my new favorite foppish lunk, the inimitable Mr. English. Though he does seem to be locked in the particularly stubborn throes of his broken-hearted malaise.</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (pleased):</span> I'm confident I can tear past the pitiable plush exterior and reveal the fragrant potpourri of heroism that lies within before curtain call!</p>

<p class="davepetasprite"><span class="prefix">DAVEPETASPRITE^2 : B33 <</span> sounds like youve had a real eventful... uh</p>
<p class="davepetasprite"><span class="prefix">DAVEPETASPRITE^2  (thinking): B33 <</span> how many w33ks of developments has this b33n i wasnt fully purring attention</p>

<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (thinking):</span> Weeks?</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (laugh):</span> Oh Davepeta, we've only been out on the town for a single, sensual, enlightening night!</p>
<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (curious):</span> Anywho, while still on the subject of the stubborn and problematic... How goes your work on the linchpin of this “oper8tion”?</p>

<p class="davepetasprite"><span class="prefix">DAVEPETASPRITE^2  (pokerface): B33 <</span> well i mean</p>
<p class="davepetasprite"><span class="prefix">DAVEPETASPRITE^2  (pokerface): B33 <</span> its going</p>

![Jasprose's eyes go wide, her hair, ears, and whiskers frizz up, and her princess hat jumps off her head.](./images/5/characters/jasprose/jasprose_shocked.webp)

<p class="davepetasprite"><span class="prefix">DAVEPETASPRITE^2  (uncomfortable): B33 <</span> this therapist shit is not easy</p>
<p class="davepetasprite"><span class="prefix">DAVEPETASPRITE^2  (thinking): B33 <</span> hmm yes the way you smashed that 3rd 8-ball indicates you have unresolved f33lings about your father</p>

<p class="davepetasprite"><span class="prefix">DAVEPETASPRITE^2  (thinking): B33 <</span> which would translate to Centralized <span class="the-point">Point</span> Time (C<span class="the-point">P</span>T) as maybe about</p>
<p class="davepetasprite"><span class="prefix">DAVEPETASPRITE^2  (pokerface): B33 <</span> 4 years</p>

<p class="jasprosesprite"><span class="prefix">JASPROSESPRITE^2 (shocked):</span> What have you even been doing there for 4 years?</p>

<p class="davepetasprite"><span class="prefix">DAVEPETASPRITE^2: B33 <</span> *dp slides up against the doorframe all slick-like, folds their arms and cocks their head forward, dropping the shades just enough for you to steal a glance at their highly coveted neon ganderbulbs*</p>
