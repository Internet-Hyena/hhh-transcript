<p class="tavros">TAVROS (nervous): fOR WHAT,</p>
<p class="vriska">VRISKA (thinking): It couldn't 8e that easy, could it?</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA: Hey. Tavros.</p>
<p class="tavros">TAVROS (smiling): hI THAT'S ME, i THINK,</p>
<p class="vriska">VRISKA: I'm sorry I killed you.</p>
<p class="tavros">TAVROS: dID YOU DO THAT,</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA (idle): </p>

<p class="tavros">TAVROS (nervous): uM VRISKA DID-</p>
<p class="vriska">VRISKA (angry): Ugh!!!!!!!!</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA (thinking): What did they mean "sort it out," then? I feel fine a8out killing Tavros, and he's certainly ok with it now. The situation's sorted!</p>
<p class="tavros">TAVROS (smiling): iS THAT TRUE,</p>
<p class="vriska">VRISKA: It's completely sorted!</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA: Damn, it could have 8een any num8er of things.</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA (smug): I did a lot of things wrong.</p>

<p class="tavros">TAVROS (nervous): aS MUCH FUN, aS I THINK YOU MAYBE THINK WE ARE MUTUALLY HAVING</p>

<p class="tavros">TAVROS: aND, i DON'T WANT TO RUIN THAT, bY</p>

<p class="box">What will you do?</p>


<p class="vriska">VRISKA: Damn it. Well even if that doesn't solve this puzzle, 8y some happenstantial miracle it's still true.</p>
<p class="tavros">TAVROS: i THINK IT'S, sOMETIMES ALRIGHT</p>

<p class="tavros">TAVROS: tO JUST STAND, tOGETHER,</p>

<p class="tavros">TAVROS: oUTSIDE OF MY HOUSE, fOR A FEW HOURS, aND,</p>

<p class="tavros">TAVROS (nervous): i AM NOT AT ALL</p>

<p class="tavros">TAVROS (smiling): hORRIBLE TO ME,</p>
<p class="vriska">VRISKA: Incredi8le! Listen to you!</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA: You have me here practically groveling at your feet.</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA: And even after all I put you through, you're still not trying to get your just desserts.</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA (sad): All this apologizing and rolling over and exposing my weaknesses isn't solving shit!</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA (smug): It's like I'm always saying, words are meaningless.</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA: What we need is action.</p>
<p class="tavros">TAVROS (nervous): i THINK MAYBE, tHAT,</p>

<p class="tavros">TAVROS: dOING uHH, "ACTIONS,"</p>

<p class="tavros">TAVROS: mIGHT BE ONE OF THE THINGS, tHAT YOU FEEL, lIKE YOU DID WRONG</p>

<p class="tavros">TAVROS: aND, mAYBE SOME WORDS, aCTUALLY,</p>

<p class="tavros">TAVROS (smiling): cAN BE PRETTY USEFUL, sOMETIMES,</p>
<p class="vriska">VRISKA: That sounds wrong, so I'm going to completely ignore it.</p>
<p class="tavros">TAVROS: oH, oK,</p>
<p class="vriska">VRISKA: 8ut sure. Let's try it your way.</p>
<p class="tavros">TAVROS (smiling eyesclosed): oH, oK,</p>
<p class="vriska">VRISKA: Instead of me taking action, what I need is for you to take action.</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA (smug): It was so o8vious that it's stupid, actually.</p>
<p class="tavros">TAVROS: tHAT'S NOT, wHAT I SAID, aT ALL,</p>
<p class="vriska">VRISKA: The reason I'm stuck here is 8ecause I don't owe you plac8ing apologies</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA: I owe you revenge. It's just that easy!</p>
<p class="tavros">TAVROS: bUT-</p>
<p class="vriska">VRISKA (smug): It's just that easy!</p>
<p class="tavros">TAVROS (idle): ...</p>
<p class="vriska">VRISKA (angry): IT'S J-</p>
<p class="tavros">TAVROS: bUT WHAT IF, sOMEONE WERE TO SAY, hYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING,</p>

<p class="tavros">TAVROS: i DON'T THINK THATS THE THING I WANT TO, uMM, bE DOING</p>

<p class="tavros">TAVROS (nervous): aT ALL, oR, eVEN SORT OF,,</p>

<p class="tavros">TAVROS: aND THAT I STILL THINK IT WAS WRONG BUT I FORGIVE YOU FOR DOING THOSE THINGS THAT YOU SAID YOU DID, tO ME EARLIER,</p>
<p class="vriska">VRISKA: No. You deserve revenge. Action 8egets action. This makes perfect sense to anyone who's 8een paying attention.</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA (thinking): </p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA: You have to throw me off this cliff.</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA: Then we'll 8e completely squared away.</p>
<p class="tavros">TAVROS (nervous): uHH I DON'T THINK-</p>

<p class="tavros">TAVROS: aND THIS MAY, uHH, sEEM COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, tO YOUR IDEA</p>

<p class="tavros">TAVROS (nervous): bUT IT SOUNDS LIKE, bEING THROWN OFF A CLIFF MIGHT NOT BE A HEALTHY COPING MECHANISM,</p>
<p class="vriska">VRISKA: It's fine! Kill me, get your revenge, and I'll finally 8e on my way.</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA (smug): Out of your life forever! Never to torment you again!</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA: And whatever version of you this is can go on living your little life playing with your little monster dolls or whatever!</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA (sad): Here on Alternia.</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA (sad): 8efore everything goes wrong.</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA: You can kill me now 8efore it's too late for you.</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA (smug): It's perfect!</p>
<p class="tavros">TAVROS (nervous): nO I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT,</p>
<p class="vriska">VRISKA: I know you have it in you. I've seen it.</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA (angry): God damn it Tavros, if you don't kill me I can't move on.</p>

<p class="vriska">VRISKA: You'd 8e doing me a favor.</p>
