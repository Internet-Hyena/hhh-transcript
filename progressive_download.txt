# RenPyWeb progressive download rules - first match applies
# '+' = progressive download, '-' = keep in game.zip (default)
# See https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/build.html#classifying-and-ignoring-files for matching

# +/- type path
#
# For omitting upcoming chapters in between releases, released chapters will be explicitly
# kept in the game.zip. A final catchall will export the remaining chapters to the
# separate game/ directory, which will be omitted from upload.
